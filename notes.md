Notes
=====

  * clean and document new components!!!

  * clean out old definitions like type constraints and unification vars

  * revise/group conditions

  * revise programs, list of decls instead
    - projection arrow
    - projections in axioms
    - remove program expression from haskell and fc

  * write readme

  * does topreactCls_w need to happen after topreactEqw? or can they be merged?
    - do it -Shia Labeouf

  * interation limit for solver

  * Value Binding Translation
    - do nosig recursion
    - check if untouchable hack is no longer required

  * parse quantified type contexts better

  - remove type patterns from impl, it's a theoretical construct

  * ~~finish wanted FD constraint generation~~
    - general transClose FD relation
