I have had the absolute pleasure of working on a thesis about Haskell, using
Haskell.  A subject that has interested me deeply before, and now has become
even more fascinating and beautiful to me. However, the road was long,
difficult, and not without its trials and tribulations.
\\\\
I would like to thank Tom Schrijvers and George Karachalias for providing me the
opportunity of working on this thesis. I am sincerely grateful for being able to
have spent this year working on something I have become truly passionate about.
In particular I would like to thank George for his help and all that he has
taught me. His support has been invaluable.

Thank you, Val√©rie Haerens, for being an endless source of happiness and
support.

Finally, thank you, the reader, for putting up with my terrible writing.
