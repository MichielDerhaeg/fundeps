\section{Planning}
At the time of writing, the implemtation is capable of type checking Haskell '98
and elaborating into System $F_C$. However the latter isn't currently being
used.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Usually in Hindley-Milner style type systems during type inference, we
        gather type equalities and compute a solution by solving them all at
        once. In more advanced type inference algorithms, there may be
        residual equalities that might remain unsolved, perhaps even
        indefinitely. The Haskell typechecker needs to be extended to support
        these unsolved constraints so they might be solved later. I expect this
        to be done by the end of January.
    \item Afterwards, the most important part and the main bulk of the work
        starts, which involves implementing the algorithm proposed by
        Karachalias and Schrijvers \cite{Karachalias:2017:EFD:3156695.3122966}.
        Depending on the severity of the complications that may be encountered
        along the way, I suspect this will take at least two months and so
        expect this to be finished by the beginning of April.
    \item Lastly, GADTs and type families will be implemented and will hopefully
        be done by the end of May.
\end{itemize}
