{\bf Thesis title:} {\em Implementation of Type Inference and Elaboration into System FC for Functional Dependencies}

{\bf Short context and goal: }
When declaring type classes with multiple parameters, it might be useful to
define functional dependencies between these paremeters to prevent any
ambiguities during type inference. This type system feature has been implemented
in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. But this implementation is incomplete and the
type checker rejects certain unambiguous programs which in theory should have a
principal type. Due to the inability to elaborate this into System F, an often
used intermediate representation for functional programming languages.

\paragraph{}
An extension of System F with type equality coercions has made elaboration
possible and the goal of this thesis is to implement a proposed solution to
discover practical issues that may arise and study how this solution interacts
with other major type system features like GADTs and Type Families.

{\bf Finished work:}
Firstly, I have studied the literature concerning type systems. I've read the
book \textit{Types and Programming Languages} and several papers about type
systems, System $F_C$ and type classes.

I've cleaned up a prototype compiler that was used for a previous project and
implented a simpler type class constraint solver so it supports similar features
as Haskell '98.

\vspace{1cm}
{\bf Main results:}
We now have an implementation of a prototype compiler for a basic functional
programming language with type classes which we can easily extend with the
features we will later require.

This implementation now supports superclasses without relying on backtracking.

\vspace{1cm}
{\bf Main difficulties:}
A significant amount of time had to be invested to familiarize myself with the
research area, but this was to be expected as I had little to no prior
knowlegde about it.

An unexpected time investment was moving from the theory to the
implementation. Figuring out which parts of the code coincided with wich parts
of the theory took an unexpected amount of effort initially. But once this
hurdle had passed and I was familiarized with the implementation, this was no
longer a issue. % don't know about this sentence structure

% non-determinism -> backtracking ?
We've opted for a type class constraint solver without non-determinism. We
therefore had to devise another method to deal with superclasses.

\vspace{1cm}
{\bf Planning:}
% TODO changeme, i'll put something here already
By the end of November I expect to have extended the target language of the
compiler, which currently is System F,  with type equality coercions. And have
finished the parts of the thesis text concerning the required background.
% better word than background

{\bf Continuing to work like this, I expect to achive a ??/20 by the end of the
thesis.}

{\bf I expect to hand in my thesis in June.}
